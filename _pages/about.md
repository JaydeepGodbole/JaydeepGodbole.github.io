Thank you for stopping by my corner of the vast internet! <br>

A brief introduction about myself
======
I am a final year student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. \\
I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology (B Tech) degree in Instrumentation Engineering as my Major, and B Tech in Computer Science and Engineering as my Minor. \\
I am interested in the applications of AI in robotics and the social sphere. My other research interests include distributed and optimal controls, control of spreading processes on networked systems and stochastic optimization.

What I do
=====
In a world hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, while I was at home social-distancing, I came across a new faculty member, Professor [Ashish Ranjan Hota](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~ahota/index.html) in my department. He was interested in the applications of estimation and control theory to modelling and controlling the spread of epidemics on networks. We were joined by Professor [Philip E. Par√©](https://sites.google.com/view/philpare) from Purdue University. Together, we conducted timely research on inference, prediction and control of SIR epidemics on networks. Our work has since been published at The 15th Workshop on the Economics of Networks, Systems and Computation ([Netecon 2020](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/netecon20/)) and an [extended version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16185) of this has been submitted to the journal IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering ([TNSE](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-tnse)). 

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, I spent most of my time in college working in the field of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. I am a team member of the student research group [Autonomous Ground Vehicle](https://www.agv.iitkgp.ac.in)(AGV), under Professor [Debashish Chakrvarty](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/MI/faculty/mi-dc). The aim of our group is to build a fully functional self driving car for Indian roads. Our group is comprised of mainly three teams. The mechanical team designs and develops the mechanical chassis of the robotic car. The electronics team is tasked with building the power, communications and low-level data transfer circuitry of the robots. The software team develops algorithms and modules for safe and efficient autonomous driving related tasks such as motion planning, control, localization, mapping, computer vision, etc. We employ state-of-the-art methods like deep reinforcement learning, model predictive control, etc to enhance the depth in the field of autonomous driving. Currently we as a group are participating in the Mahindra Rise Prize. We are among the top 13 teams chosen out of 400+ teams tasked with building a self-driving cars for Indian Roads. At our lab, we have industry grade robots like the Husky and Jackal UGVs from Clearpath Robotics. We also possess several 2D and 3D Lidars including the Velodyne 32E, stereo cameras and a plethora of other advanced sensors. On the simulation side of testing, we have the CarSim simulation software, where we test our codes before they can be deployed on the real world robots. We also take part in international competitions like the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC), where we placed second consequtively twice in the 2018 and the 2019 versions of it in the AutoNav Challenge, out of around 40 teams that competed from the world over. The problem statement of the event was to build an autonomous robot that can traverse in an arena marked by lanes and navigate from one world point to another specified by the GPS coordinates of the points while avoiding obstacles in the way.
